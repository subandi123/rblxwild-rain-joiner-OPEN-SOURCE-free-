# Why OpenSource?
its shit, using playwright ( browser related library )..

# Some Advantage on the open source one
1. Supports multiple accounts
2.  could just write 1 in "howmanyshouldweopen" config, to join in 4 account or more, depends on ur pc
3.  -Opensource

# How to use the free one
1. run installer.bat
2. edit authorization to ur rblxwild authtoken and howmanyshouldweopen to ur choice, ( if u write 1, it will only open 1 chronium to generate hcaptcha token, if u write 2, it will only open 2 chronium to generate hcaptcha token and continues )
3. run assa.py
